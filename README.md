# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Project Overview

Pewlett Hackard is a large company that employs upon tens of thousands of people. Many have been with the company for a very long time and remain loyal. However, many of those loyal employees have retirement plans on the horizon. The purpose of this project is to determine how many people in Pewlett Hackard are nearing retirment age and under which departments. From gathering this knowledge, we can take this information and create a list of potential mentors within the company to train the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees. 

## Results/Summary

From running this analysis, we were able to determine the following: 

- 90938 Pewlett Hackard employees are in the retirement age range
- The most impacted departments from the "silver tsunami" will be to our Senior Engineers and Senior Staff with 29414 and 28254 respectively at retirement age
- There are 1449 employees that are eligible to act as mentors within Pewlett Hackard who are born in 1965.
- Out of 300024 employees, 30.3% are in retirement age and only 0.5% of employees fit the current criteria to be an eligible mentor. 

In looking that these above facts, we see that we have a TON of people set to retire soon and not nearly enough mentors in position to help train up the next generation of Pewlett Hackard staff. To address this issue, we should expand our current mentorship criteria. Currently, it's set to only allow people born in 1965 to be eligible. To be mentorship eligible, it should not be based on the employee's age but based on the employee's time in their current role. Instead of using `birth_date`, `from_date` could make a better measurement of determining mentorship eligibility. If someone is in their current role for at least 2-3 years, they could be eligible to act as a mentor within their department. 

Further, it may be a good idea to look at how managers are impacted by the "silver tsunami". It seems with only 2 managers reaching the retirement age, there are many other managers out there who could potentially be added to the pool of mentorship candidates
